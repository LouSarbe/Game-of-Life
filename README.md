# Game-of-Life

Open-source project made based of the famous game by mathematician John Horton Conway.

# Build

Download the project and build it using these commands :

$ python -m venv venv

$ source venv/bin/activate

(venv) $ python -m pip install -e .

# State

The game works and we can launch different patterns changing the default argument.

# Possible upgrades

We could have a menu where we can choose the pattern we would like to launch. 

We could implement a never ending pattern with a stop button.

We could implement a pattern creator.

Also we could change the code so the 'terminal is too small' error does not strike.

Reorganise the project git (.gitignore etc)
