# Game-of-Life

Open-source project made based of the famous game by mathematician John Horton Conway.

# Build

Download the project and run app.py on your python environment !
Launch the app.py for the code to start running !

You can modify the pattern at the 146th line of app.py. For now it is on Pulsar but you can put Random, Blinker, Toad, Beacon, Penta Decathlon, Glider, Glider Gun or Bunnies.

# State

The game works and we can launch different patterns changing the default argument.

# Possible upgrades

We could have a menu where we can choose the pattern we would like to launch. 

We could implement a never ending pattern with a stop button.

We could implement a pattern creator.

Also we could change the code so the 'terminal is too small' error does not strike.
